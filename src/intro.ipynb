    "Project Phases\n",
    "1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by defining the business problem and then landing it into a machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A problem defined is a problem half solved” - Albert Einstein\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "How will you collect the data? Is it an existing public dataset? Will you have to merge data from different sources? Maybe do some web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fundamental part because in a real life project, depending on the data you have, the problem can be solved with the existing data or maybe you will have to convince your client that paying for more data is really needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore your data as much as you can to find important patterns and relationships between features. Use graphs to explain this patterns. This will be important to show in your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean your data to build a good model, because poor quality data will always produce faulty results. You can go back to your data preprocessing module to remember all the steps needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is a classification problem, is your data balanced? If not, consider resampling it, or make sure to pick the correct evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does your data have a lot of outliers? Are they normal values from your population or should you drop them? or even better, impute them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Will your model require normalization? Maybe you are dealing with a robust algorithm to train and normalization is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make yourself all this questions before training your model. Who knows these are the same questions you will be asked at your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Garbage in, garbage out.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model and results\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick one or more algorithms to train, evaluate and hypertune. Choose the one you will be working with and save it for the deployment step.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a machine learning web application using your saved model. You can use Flask, Streamlit or any other tool that you know. Use Heroku or another cloud computing platform that you prefere to deploy your web application and share it with the world."
