    "## 4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean your data to build a good model, because poor quality data will always produce faulty results. You can go back to your data preprocessing module to remember all the steps needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is a classification problem, is your data balanced? If not, consider resampling it, or make sure to pick the correct evaluation metric.\n",

    "Does your data have a lot of outliers? Are they normal values from your population or should you drop them? or even better, impute them?\n",

    "Will your model require normalization? Maybe you are dealing with a robust algorithm to train and normalization is not needed.\n",

    "Build a machine learning web application using your saved model. You can use Flask, Streamlit or any other tool that you know. Use Heroku or another cloud computing platform that you prefere to deploy your web application and share it with the world."
